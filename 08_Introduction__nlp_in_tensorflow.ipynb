        "\n",
        "> 🔑 **Note:** Both of these types of data are often referred to as *sequences* (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called *seq2seq*, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",

        "\n",
        "> 🤔 **Question:** What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data? \n",
        "\n",
        "If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n",
        "\n",
        "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
        "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
        "  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
        "  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
        "  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n",
        "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings: \n",
        "  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
        "  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n",
        "*Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens).*\n",
        "\n",
        "> 🤔 **Question:** What level of tokenzation should I use? What embedding should should I choose?\n",
        "\n",
        "It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)). \n",
        "\n",
        "If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 🔑 **Note:** Much like searching for a pre-trained computer vision model, you can search for pre-trained word embeddings to use for your problem. Try searching for something like \"use pre-trained word embeddings in TensorFlow\"."

        "Many production systems use an **ensemble** (multiple different models combined) of models to make a prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea behind model stacking is that if several uncorrelated models agree on a prediction, then the prediction must be more robust than a prediction made by a singular model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The keyword in the sentence above is **uncorrelated**, which is another way of saying, different types of models. For example, in our case, we might combine our baseline, our bidirectional model and our TensorFlow Hub USE model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although these models are all trained on the same data, they all have a different way of finding patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we were to use three similarly trained models, such as three LSTM models, the predictions they output will likely be very similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as trying to decide where to eat with your friends. If you all have similar tastes, you'll probably all pick the same restaurant. But if you've all got different tastes and still end up picking the same restaurant, the restaurant must be good.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we're working with a classification problem, there are a few of ways we can combine our models:\n",
        "1. **Averaging** - Take the output prediction probabilities of each model for each sample, combine them and then average them.\n",
        "2. **Majority vote (mode)** - Make class predictions with each of your models on all samples, the predicted class is the one in majority. For example, if three different models predict `[1, 0, 1]` respectively, the majority class is `1`, therefore, that would be the predicted label.\n",
        "3. **Model stacking** - Take the outputs of each of your chosen models and use them as inputs to another model.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 📖 **Resource:** The above methods for model stacking/ensembling were adapted from Chapter 6 of the [Machine Learning Engineering Book](http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php) by Andriy Burkov. If you're looking to enter the field of machine learning engineering, not only building models but production-scale machine learning systems, I'd highly recommend reading it in its entirety.\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, the concept of model stacking is best seen in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to combine our baseline model (`model_0`), LSTM model (`model_2`) and our USE model trained on the full training data (`model_6`) by averaging the combined prediction probabilities of each."
